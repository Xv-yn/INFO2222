# Lecture 1 Welcome and Introduction

Cybersecurity an be applied to any form of data protection. This includes communication, computation, cyber physical, finance, etc. More specifically. it involves the protection of networks, systems, data, physical objects, etc. When protecting data, security must be applied to all aspects, from the system to networks, to data/software, etc.

'Cyber' referring to the culture of computers and digital technology and 'Security' referring to the protection of something. Thus, meaning the protection in the digital world (protection of anything, mostly data though). 

When designing an interface for any scenario, two aspects that must be considered are:
- Security
- Usability

### Relationship between Security and Usability

#### Security
Security refers to the protection of a system and data from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.

#### Usability
Usability refers to the ease of use, efficiency, and satisfaction of your users when they use a system.

#### Balance
There must always be a balance between usability and security.

Consider the scenario of maximizing security by transitioning everything to analog, including phones, handwritten mail, computers, diaries, and calculations. This approach ensures robust data security due to a singular access method. However, it compromises usability significantly, as this singular method often proves less convenient and efficient for users. Retrieving or inputting information becomes a cumbersome process, hindering the seamless flow of daily tasks.

On the flip side, prioritizing usability over security allows for a more accessible and convenient user experience. BY utilizing digital advancements in phones, email, computers, and data storage allows for people to benefit from the flexibility of multiple access methods, enhancing productivity and collaboration. However, this approach introduces security vulnerabilities, as the increased accessibility may expose sensitive information to potential threats.
Hence, having the right balance between usability and security is crucial.

### Principles of Cyber Security

#### Integrity
Ensuring data is accurate and reliable

#### Access Control // Authentication
Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users

#### Confidentiality
Protecting data from unauthorized disclosure

#### Authorization
Preventing unauthorized modification of data

#### Availability
Ensuring timely and reliable access to data and resources

### Encryption

#### Symmetric Encryption
A means of encrypting data such that a single key is used for both encryption and decryption. This allows for a more efficient means of communicating data securely. Simply put, symmetric encryption is better for larger data sets.

#### Asymmetric Encryption
A means of encryption where a public key is used for encryption, but a private key must be used for decryption. This means that many people can send encrypted messages, but only a few people with the decryption key can read the messages.This is better for smaller data transfers and is more secure than Symmetric Encryption.
